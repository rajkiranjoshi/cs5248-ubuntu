# cs5248-ubuntu

This is a customized "ubuntu:latest + openssh server" Docker image to be used by a server admin assisting in hosting server-side components of course projects. While this image is customized for CS5248 at NUS School of Computing, it is still general enough to be amenable for other course projects.
